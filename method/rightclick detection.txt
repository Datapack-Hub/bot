There are multiple ways to detect rightclicks using datapacks/commands, here is a quick rundown on each of them and their cons and pros! 
You can get more detailed instructions on how to use them using their corresponding `/method`s

## Warped Funguns on a Stick (WFOAS)/Carrot on a Stick (COAS)
This method works by using an `item.used` which triggers when using either of the two items and then running commands as/at players with a score of 1 or higher.

Pros: 
- easy to pull off
- works in any world
- doesn't require additional entities

Cons:
- wfoas attracts striders/coas pigs and rabbit

Depends:
- detects up to 5 clicks/second when holding rightclick


## Eye of Ender (EoE)
This method works by using an advancement to detect whenever a player uses an eye of ender and then executing code as/at them.

Pros:
- doesn't require additional entities 
- doesn't attract mobs
- doesn't need to run every tick

Cons:
- slows player down when holding rightclick
- only works in worlds without strongholds (there are ways to work around this, although these are way less performant)

Depends:
- detects up to 20 clicks/second when holding rightclick 
- bound to the player, not a specific location

## Interaction Entities
This method works by using an advancement to check wether a player interacted with an interaction entity and then executing code

Pros:
- see "depends"
- can also detect leftclicks

Cons:
- requires an additional entity

Depends:
- detects up to 5 clicks/second when holding rightclick
- bound to a specific location, not player 
- can't be interacted through
