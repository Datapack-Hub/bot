There are multiple ways to detect rightclicks using datapacks/commands, all of them having their pros and cons 

## Warped Funguns on a Stick (wfoas)/Carrot on a Stick (coas)
Pros: 
- easy to pull off
- works in any world
- doesn't require additional entities

Cons:
- wfoas attracts striders/coas pigs and rabbit

Depends:
- detects up to 5 clicks/second

This method works by using an `item.used` which triggers when using either of the two items and then running commands as/at players with a score of 1 or higher. For the sake of simplicity the following example will use a coas, if you want to change that you can just `carrot_on_a_stick` in the load function with `warped_fungus_on_a_stick`!

`load.mcfunction`

```hs
# adds the objective to be usable later on
scoreboard objectives add rightclick minecraft.used:minecraft.carrot_on_a_stick 
```

`main.mcfunction`

```hs 
# runs the "rightclick_run" as players who used a coas (you can also specify special item nbt here by using a predicate or using "execute if data entity @s", you will still have to reset the score on EVERY click if you don't want the pack to break tho)
execute as @a[scores={rightlick=1}] run function namespace:rightclick_run 
```

`rightclick_run.mcfunction`

```hs
# announces the use of the item in chat, feel free to replace this with whatever
say Used COAS 
# sets the rightclick score to 0 so it can be used again
scoreboard players set @s rightclick 0 
```

## Eye of Ender (eoe)
Pros:
- doesn't require additional entities 
- doesn't attract mobs
- doesn't need to run every tick

Cons:
- only works in worlds without strongholds

Depends:
- detects up to 20 clicks/second 
- bound to the player, not a specific location

This method works by using an advancement to detect whenever a player uses an eye of ender and then executing code as/at them.

`used_eye_of_ender.json` (located in your packs `advancements` folder, you can also add an nbt tag to the nbt field in `items` to make this only run when specific eoes are used)

```json
{
  "criteria": {
    "requirement": {
      "trigger": "minecraft:using_item",
      "conditions": {
        "item": {
          "items": [
            "minecraft:ender_eye"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "rewards": {
    "function": "namespace:rightclick_run"
  }
}
```

`rightclick_run` (located in your packs `functions` folder)

```hs
# announces the use of the item in chat, feel free to replace this with whatever
say Used eoe
# revokes the advancement from the player so it can be used again
advancement revoke @s only namespace:used_eye_of_ender
```

## Display Entities
Pros:
- see "depends"
- can also detect leftclicks

Cons:
- requires an additional entity

Depends:
- detects up to 20 clicks/second
- bound to a specific location, not entity 
- can't be interacted through

This method works by using an advancement to check wether a player interacted with an interaction entity and then executing code

`interacted_with_interaction.json` (located in the packs `advancements` folder)

```hs
{
  "criteria": {
    "requirement": {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_interacted_with_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": {
          "type": "minecraft:interaction"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "rewards": {
    "function": "namespace:rightclick_run"
  }
}
```

`rightclick_run.mcfunction` (located in the packs `functions` folder)
```hs
# announces the use of the item in chat, feel free to replace this with whatever
say Used interaction 
advancement revoke @s only namespace:interacted_with_interaction
```
