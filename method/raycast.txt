Raycasting is a method used to, well, cast a ray and find out where it lands.
It is achieved by recursively moving the position a function is running at by a minimal amount each iteration until it hits something.

Example:
`start_raycast.mcfunction`
```hs
execute anchored eyes positioned ^ ^ ^0.1 run function namespace:raycast
```
`raycast.mcfunction`
```hs
# Sends chat message as soon as the raycast hits a block
execute positioned ^ ^ ^0.1 if block ~ ~ ~ #namespace:transparent run say Raycast hit block
# Continues raycast if conditions are fulfilled
execute positioned ^ ^ ^0.1 unless block ~ ~ ~ #namespace:transparent function namespace:raycast
```

There are also plenty videos on this aviable, for example this one by CloudWolf: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XWkA6bF36c)
