This means that most resource packs for earlier versions won't work in 1.19.3. \n\nThere are two ways to fix this:\n- Move your custom textures into `assets/minecraft/textures/item/...`, since all textures in the `item` (or `block`) folders are loaded by default.\n- Create an atlas file for your custom textures. An atlas file basically tells Minecraft to always load the textures in your custom folder. [This video](https://youtu.be/MHWX_GaK2g0) will explain how to do this.",
