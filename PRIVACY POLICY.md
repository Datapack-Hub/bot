# Privacy Policy
====================

## Data Usage
The bot has access to any message sent in any discord server it is in. (As far as permissions allow it to, it can't access messages in channels it can't view.) That data is NOT stored and only used to make the `MCfunction` syntax highlighting work. This requires the message content to be acessible to the bot so it can recognise messages as using `MCfunction` as programming language within a code block and for it to resend a highlighted version of that message afterwards.
