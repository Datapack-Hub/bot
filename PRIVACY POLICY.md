Privacy Policy

## Stored Information
The bot may automatically store the `server id` of any server it gets added to.

## Data Removal
### Automatical
A server's `id` automatically instantly gets removed from the bots storage once it gets removed from that server.

### Manual
Members with the `manage_guild` permission can manually remove a server's `id` by running the `/highlighter` Discord slash command and clicking the "Disable" button. In case that button doesn't show up, the bot isn't currently storing that server's `id`.

## Data Usage
The bot uses the stored server `id`'s to figure out wether detected messages were sent in a server with the bot's `mcfunction` syntax highlighting function enabled. No usage of data outside of the aformentioned cases will happen and the data is not shared with any 3rd-party site or service.
